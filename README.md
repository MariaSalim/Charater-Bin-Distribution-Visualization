# Charater-Bin-Distribution-Visualization

This provides the data visualization for the frequency distribution of alphabets in a given text 

- It takes a text input and a number of bins as parameters
   + It extracts only alphabets from the input text and converts them to lowercase
   + It calculates the frequency count of each alphabet and determines the frequency distribution of bins based on the number of bins specified
   + It updates and displays two types of visualizations:
      Bar Chart: Each bar represents the frequency of alphabets in a particular bin. The x-axis represents the bins, and the y-axis represents the frequency count
      Pie Chart: Each slice represents a bin, and the size of the slice represents the frequency of alphabets in that bin
      
- The code also provides interactive features in the visualizations:
   + Mouse click green colors the corresponding bin in the pie chart and the effect is gone in 1 second
   + Mouse over slightly increases height, displays the frequency label, and makes the corresponding bin opaque.
